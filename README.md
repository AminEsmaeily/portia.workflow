# Portia Workflow

Portia Workflow is a lightweight JQuery based plugin that provides some features like Workflow designer and Workflow Engine to create and run new dynamic workflows in other projects. Currently, Portia Workflow has a small number of native activities but we are trying to create other new activities. You can create your custom activities in it of course but it needs that you have a good experience in jQuery and read the Portia Workflow documentation carefully.  
Portia Workflow engine can run any type of activities, so we can create custom activities and run them on the server side. To do this we should create a parser in the server to translate the output of the designed workflow to the expected business.  
You can find documentation and samples [here](https://aminesmaeily.github.io/portia.workflow/).
